At the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, she determined how to apply the Generative Adversarial Network to her code, overcoming the lack of machine learning courses at her university. She decided to further her education at Columbia University, where she works toward a master’s degree in Computer Engineering. As a student, she led a four-person team to build an Alpha Gomoku Game, solving disagreements and finding the best solution in limited time. She is an encouraging and diligent team player. Her ability to problem-solve and cooperate will enable her to succeed in the future.",
